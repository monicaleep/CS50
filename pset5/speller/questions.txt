0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
    It is the longest word in our "large" dictionary at 45 letters. It is a lung disease caused by inhalation of quartz dust
1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
    It gets resource usage for a program.
2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
    18 - 2 structs and 16 longs
3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though weâ€™re not changing their contents?
    Because the actual values of rusage are quite large to copy over, so it would be easier just to make a pointer to the value to save memory.
4.  TODO
5.  why are we using fgetc instead of fscanf?
    because we know the size on one Char and can avoid dynamically allocating memory for a changing length string from fscanf. also since fscanf reads a whole word at once, we would need to put an extra step anyways to check for any numbers or ' 
6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
    to avoid accidentally modifying them in the functions
