1.  stdint.h is a library which provides a set of typedefs to make integers of a standard width. This will standardize the integer width over different systems.
2.  this will ensure that the int will be the same size regardless of the system memory allocation (64-bit or 32-bit system) that the program is run on.
3.  1, 4, 4, 2.
4.  the first two bytes of bitmapfileheader are a WORD bfType must be 'BM'
5.  bfSize vs biSize? bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file which includes the header info. biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  if biHeight is negative? it indicates a top-down DIB
7.  biBitCount specifies the color depth.
8.  fopen might return null if the input or output files are not accessible.
9.  the third argument to fread is always 1 in our code because we are reading each individual structure one at a time
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3? 3
11. what does FSEEK do? it "fast forwards" to skip any part of the file
12. What is SEEK_CUR? SEEK_CUR means to start the seeking from the current position in the file pointer.
